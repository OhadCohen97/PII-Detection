# NLP PII-Detection

what is PII?

PII (Personal Identifying Information) is any information that can be considered private by a user - as it can be used to identify them (name, address, ID number), exploit them (such as credit card information or passwords), or by just being personal information they would not like to share (such as health conditions, sexual orientation, etc.).

What is considered PII is not always clear - Credit card numbers can always be used for exploitation, but sexual orientation is not necessarily secret. Moreover, salaries of most people are usually private, but information on politicians and movie stars salaries is public.


The data is a CSV file with 2 columns—“text” containing relevant text and “target” containing a boolean (True is PII, False is not PII).
